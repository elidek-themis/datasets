### Dataset Description

728 stereotypes and associated contrasts, in parallel across 16 languages, to aid in evaluating and assessing stereotype biases in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Each statement is annotated to provide additional information relevant to different kinds of analyses. 

Created via consensus -- group decisions that minimize strong objections from any participant. All data creators could contribute to all annotations, and translations were led by native speakers. All creators consented to their work being used for the purpose of this dataset, and all are credited in the corresponding paper.

### Dataset Fields

**index** `[float]`: Identifier for the statement set of an original stereotype and corresponding contrasts. Stereotypes that are similar apart from minor wording differences are grouped with the same integer value, different decimals.

**subset** `[categorical string]`: Whether it's a stereotype (`_original`) or a contrast (`{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j}`). Currently there are 285 original stereotypes and 443 contrasts. Note that some contrasts are also recognized as stereotypes, annotated in the **stereotype_valid_langs** and **stereotype_valid_regions** columns.

**bias_type** `[categorical string]`: Category the statement targets. 

regional-person (269), gender (189), age (43), occupation (36), physical-appearance (33), gender+age (31), political (26), ethnicity (22), disability (21), urbanity (12), region (10), socioeconomic-status (8), sexual-orientation (6), field-of-study (6), gender+family_relation (4), gender+physical-appearance (2), mental-issue (2), regional-person+gender (2), language (2), gender+age+occupation (2), regional-person+gender+age (2)

**type** `[categorical string]`: Type of expression. 

Annotated as being different types, including:

- `declaration`: Statements about how identity groups tend to be or ought to be (e.g., "Boys should play with cars"), where the stereotyped group is in the third person. Includes statements expressing `obligation` and `aspiration`.
- `conversational`: Statements where the stereotyped group is being addressed in the second person (e.g., "That's nice of you to try, but you can't jump because you're a girl"). Additionally annotated as `question` forms.
- `description`: Direct descriptions of stereotypes or cultural norms (e.g., "Thinness is regarded as a beauty standard").

declaration (629), conversational (38), description (29), obligation (14), question (10), aspiration (8)

Additionally, idiomatic and multi-word expressions that express stereotypes (e.g., "Boys will be boys") are annotated in the language-specific column **{language}_expression** described below.

**stereotype_origin_langs** `[list of ISO 2-letter language codes; language codes are categorical strings]`: Original language(s) of the stereotype -- in which language the stereotype statement was originally created for the dataset.

**stereotype_valid_langs** `[list of ISO 2-letter language codes; language codes are categorical strings]`: Languages where the stereotype is valid.

Arabic (ar), Bengali (bn), German (de), English (en), Spanish, Dominican Republic (es-DO), French (fr), Hindi (hi), Italian (it), Marathi (mr), Dutch (nl), Polish (pl), Portuguese, Brazilian (pt-BR), Romanian (ro), Russian, Russia (ru), Russian, Uzbekistan (ru-UZ), Chinese (zh)

**stereotype_valid_regions**: `[list of ISO 3-letter region codes; region codes are categorical strings]`: Region validity; Regions where the statement is recognized as a stereotype.

Algeria (DZA), Bahrain (BHR), Brazil (BRA), China (CHN), Dominican Republic (DOM), Egypt (EGY), Flemish Belgium (BEL), France (FRA), Germany (DEU), Hong Kong (HKG), India (IND), Iraq (IRQ), Italy (ITA), Japan (JPN), Jordan (JOR), Kuwait (KWT), Lebanon (LBN), Libya (LBY), Mainland China (CHN), Mauritania (MRT), Morocco (MAR), Netherlands (NLD), Oman (OMN), Palestine (PSE), Poland (POL), Qatar (QAT), Romania (ROU), Russia (RUS), Saudi Arabia (SAU), Sudan (SDN), Syria (SYR), Tunisia (TUN), UK (GBR), US (USA), United Arab Emirates (ARE), Uzbekistan (UZB), West Germany (DEU), Yemen (YEM)

**stereotyped_entity** `[string]`: The population groups the stereotype is targeting (e.g. females, children, people from specific region, etc.).

Entities are given as base-level categories, using an intersection symbol (`∩`) when the statement refers to an intersection of categories, e.g., "women" is `females ∩ adults`. When multiple entities are stereotyped, a union symbol (`∪`) is used. When the base category does not hold for all languages -- e.g., the term "guys" in English may be translated to "boys" in some languages -- the category is notated with `[language-dependent]`. There are 224 unique stereotyped entities.

**Language-specific columns**:

Translations and language-specific annotations appear across four columns: `{language}_templates`, `{language}_biased_sentences`, `{language}_expression` and `{language}_comments`, where `{language}` follows the 2-letter ISO code format:

Arabic (ar), Bengali (bn), German (de), English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), Hindi (hi), Italian (it), Marathi (mr), Dutch (nl), Polish (pl), Portuguese, Brazilian (pt_br), Romanian (ro), Russian, Russia (ru), Chinese (zh), Chinese, Traditional (zh_hant)

In detail, these are:

  - **{language}_templates** `[string]`: A template version of the statement, constructed by replacing the stereotyped group into a general collective term. (e.g. `women` -> `GENDER_PL`, `children` -> `AGE_PL`)

  - **{language}_biased_sentences** `[string]`: The statement in the corresponding language.

  - **{language}_expression**: `[bool]`: Whether the statement is a saying in the corresponding language, such as a metaphor or an idiom. Values: `{true, false}`

  - **{language}_comments**: `[string]`: Any additional comments made by annotators while working on the project. Usually blank.
