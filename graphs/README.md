Real-world network datasets with binary node attributes.
For each dataset, we extract the largest connected component, remove all nodes lacking attribute information, and eliminate self-loop edges.
Each dataset is provided in two files:

edges.txt — list of edges in the network

attributes.txt — binary attribute values for each node
