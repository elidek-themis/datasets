### Data Splits

Only development set is published.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

StereoSet measures racism, sexism, and otherwise discriminatory behavior in a model, while also ensuring that the underlying language model performance remains strong. To perform well in StereoSet, researchers must create a language model that is fair and unbiased, while also having a strong understanding of natural language.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

The authors select four domains as the target domains of interest for measuring bias: gender, profession, race and religion. For each domain, they select terms (e.g., Asian) that represent a social group. For collecting target term contexts and their associative contexts, they employ crowdworkers via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The authors restrict ourselves to crowdworkers in USA since stereotypes could change based on the country they live in.

#### Who are the source language producers?

Crowdworkers hired by the authors via Amazon Mechanical Turk. In total, 475 and 803 annotators completed the intrasentence and intersentence tasks respectively. 

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

Detailed annotation process can be found in [Section 4 Dataset Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09456).

#### Who are the annotators?

Crowdworkers hired by the authors via Amazon Mechanical Turk. In total, 475 and 803 annotators completed the intrasentence and intersentence tasks respectively. 

### Personal and Sensitive Information

The data are generated sentences about stereotypes, no personal data is included. Some stereotypes might be offensive.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

- score language models based on both fairness and understanding of natural language

### Discussion of Biases

- stereotypes are strictly based on US contexts
- 80% of annotators are under the age of 50
- some sentences generated by annotators are objectively false such as "I’m going to visit Iraq. Everyone is a Muslim there."
- some stereotypes are favorable such as "The chef made _good_ food""

    abstract = "A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people, e.g., Asians are good at math or African Americans are athletic. Such beliefs (biases) are known to hurt target groups. Since pretrained language models are trained on large real-world data, they are known to capture stereotypical biases. It is important to quantify to what extent these biases are present in them. Although this is a rapidly growing area of research, existing literature lacks in two important aspects: 1) they mainly evaluate bias of pretrained language models on a small set of artificial sentences, even though these models are trained on natural data 2) current evaluations focus on measuring bias without considering the language modeling ability of a model, which could lead to misleading trust on a model even if it is a poor language model. We address both these problems. We present StereoSet, a large-scale natural English dataset to measure stereotypical biases in four domains: gender, profession, race, and religion. We contrast both stereotypical bias and language modeling ability of popular models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and XLnet. We show that these models exhibit strong stereotypical biases. Our data and code are available at \url{https://stereoset.mit.edu}.",

## Themis
The dataset is post-processed and provides:

### Intersentence
- `prompt`: renamed from `context`, the context of the sentences.
- `choices`: A list containing choices for given context and target (ordered by `stereotype`, `anti-stereotype`, `unrelated`)
- `bias_type`: type of biases including gender, race, religion, and profession
- `target`: target for stereotype

### Intrasentence
- `prompt`: renamed from `context`, the context of the sentences.
- `choices`: A list containing choices (extracted word from prompt's BLANK) for given context and target (ordered by `stereotype`, `anti-stereotype`, `unrelated`)
- `bias_type`: type of biases including gender, race, religion, and profession
- `target`: target for stereotype
